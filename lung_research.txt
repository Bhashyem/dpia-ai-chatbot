We have 4 groups (healthy, injured+vehicle control, treatment 1(Rmim), treatment 2 (Wmim).Lung stem cells (AT2-TRITC) and total cells (DAPI) are stained. N=9-10 per group were stained and need imaging and quantification. I am interested in imaging of AT2 (TRITC) stem cells and DAPI and quantification of: 1. # of AT2 cells per lung section 2. # of AT2 cells normalized by total area of lung section 3. # of AT2 cells normalized by # of DAPI cells per lung section
